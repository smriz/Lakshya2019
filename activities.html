               The inaugural of the Entrepreneurship Development Cell, Lakshya is always one of the most important annual events at SSN because it has the power to either create or not create an impression amongst the students for that academic year to either be a part of not be a part of the Cell. For this reason, it has been a ritual to invite an inspiring and powerful speaker to stress the importance of not just entrepreneurship but the importance of everyone to be aware of activities outside of academics. <br/><br/>

Lakshya's inaugural in 2015 did indeed witness such an individual to address the gathering. Mr. Vikram Bhaskaran, CEO of 'germ.io,' entered the auditorium of about 200 students with the aim to have some fun and inspire them and left after achieving the same. 
<br/><br/>
Vikram, who did his schooling in PSBB and continued to do an undergraduate degree in IT at SSN, started his professional career at Zoho. He was key in building their PR team and a very good division in Marketing. He then worked for a brief period in Fusioncharts before he earned his Masters' degree in Marketing from Georgia State University, USA. As one of the early employees of Freshdesk, he built an extremely efficient marketing team from scratch which has now evolved into one of the best in the country. With a constant passion towards entrepreneurship, he did not give up after a failed startup but instead took it as a learning experience to develop his game in it. Currently, he is the CEO of germ.io, a project management software product that is located in Bengaluru and backed by Accel Partners and Tiger Global. 
<br/><br/>
His talk too, was about his experience and how he faced it at every step. He reminded the audience about how many opportunities are there today and how it's never too late to follow one's passion. He also spoke about Entrepreneurship and its hardships while delineating differences between taking the conventional and unconventional paths to achieve something big and close to the heart. Indeed, the best part about the event was the connect he had with the students as an alumnus of SSN and his jovial nature to keep them engrossed in what he had to say. What better way to get inspired than by someone who was once upon a time in your shoes! 
<br/><br/>
As one of the better inaugurals of the club through the years, there was definitely a feeling of satisfaction of having attended a good talk and enthusiasm to come back for the other activities of the club amongst the attendees. 
<br/><br/>
The session ended with an interactive round of questions and answers, following which the office bearers of Lakshya presented an account of the club's planned activities for the academic year.
